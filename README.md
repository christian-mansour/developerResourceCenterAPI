# Developer Resource Center

## The App
Developer Resource Center is an API for developers to receive quick access to documentation, helpful videos, tutorials and other useful information. The API has two endpoints: one to recieve every topic and its resources and another to recieve a single topic and its resources. All data is received as a JSON object.

## Technologies Used
Node.js, Express.js, NoSQL with MongoDB, Mongoose, Material Design Lite, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX

I used the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node) to build a database for my API and to build routes for GET requests to the endpoints of my API.

I used Mongoose to create and save data into my database on mLab. mLab is the hub that houses all the topics and resources of my API.

I used CSS to style everything along with Google's Material Design Lite to make my page extremely user friendly.
